Splitted configuration
======================

Since my .emacs is quite big (about 1k lines), and since I use GNU
Emacs both Windows and GNU Linux distros, the need of a better separation 
of concerns arose. 


Sample configuration
====================

$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/dfa/emacs-stuff splitted-init
then add to your  ~/.emacs the following setup:

(setq splitted-init-dir "~/splitted-init")
(setq load-path (cons splitted-init-dir load-path))
(load-library "splitted-init") 
(load-splitted-init splitted-init-dir)


desiderata
==========

- a cool project name 
- use add-to-list in auto-insert-alist
- C-M-q should be mapped to M-S-f (as in netbeans)
- F4 open/returns to ERC
- call (use 'clojure.contrib.repl-utils) with repl-hook
- clojure mode config: http://wiki.unto.net/setting-up-clojure-and-slime
- clojure mode on windows depends on clojure box
- secure-string-match first arg cannot be nil
- (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'copyright-update)


done
====

- rpm-spec-mode
- graphviz-mode
- implemented discovery of .el files
- provide/require for splitted-init.el
- use C-space to complete symbol (as in netbeans)
- remove worthless functions
- removed compile-mode 
- use system-type to load different os specific configurations
