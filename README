Splitted configuration
======================

Since my .emacs is quite big (about 1k lines), and since I use GNU
emacs both windows and linux distro, the need of better separation 
of concerns in my configuration. 

My new layout is:

basic.el       - basic editing commands
flyspell.el    - flyspell stuff
smart-tab.el   - my smart-tab
elisp.el       - elisp
clojure.el     - clojure mode as well as slime 
c.el           - C mode
perl.el        
python.el
html.el
latex.el
hg.el     - mercurial stuff
erc.el    - ERC configuration
gui.el    - windows stuff
keymap.el - global keybindings

before.el      - includes all the os indipendent stuff
windows.el     - windows specific customizations (includes common.el)
ubuntu.el      - ubuntu specific customizations  (include commo
after.el       - called after all stuff is loaded (for recentf)

.emacs         - the final .emacs, it loads base.el, then windows.el
		 or ubuntu.el, finally it loads after.el


desiderata
==========

- C-M-q should be mapped to M-S-f (as in netbeans)
- F4 open/returns to ERC
- call (use 'clojure.contrib.repl-utils) with repl-hook
- clojure mode config: http://wiki.unto.net/setting-up-clojure-and-slime
- clojure mode on windows depends on clojure box
- compile-mode is broken
- remove worthless functions
- secure-string-match first arg cannot be nil
- skeleton-pair or my inser-pair
- use C-space to complete symbol (as in netbeans)
- use windows-type to load different os specific configurations
