Split init for GNU Emacs
========================

Since my .emacs is quite big, and since I use GNU Emacs both Windows
and GNU/Linux, the need of a better separation of concerns arose.


Sample configuration
====================

$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/dfa/emacs-stuff split-init

then add to your  ~/.emacs the following setup:

(setq split-init-dir "~/split-init")
(setq load-path (cons split-init-dir load-path))
(load-library "split-init") 
(load-split-init split-init-dir)


todo
====

- ship as separate library
- improve python mode
- use add-to-list in auto-insert-alist
- C-M-q should be mapped to M-S-f (as in netbeans)
- F4 open/returns to ERC
- secure-string-match first arg cannot be nil
- (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'copyright-update)


done
====

- clojure setup vastly improved
- rpm-spec-mode
- graphviz-mode
- implemented discovery of .el files
- provide/require for splitted-init.el
- use C-space to complete symbol (as in netbeans)
- remove worthless functions
- removed compile-mode 
- use system-type to load different os specific configurations
